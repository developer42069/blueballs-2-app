## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Since your GitHub repo is already connected to Cloudflare Pages, the deployment should happen automatically:

1. Go to [Cloudflare Pages Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select your **blueballs-2** project
3. The latest commit should automatically trigger a build
4. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
5. Once deployed, test the authentication flow

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via Wrangler

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Make sure wrangler is installed
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
npx wrangler login

# Deploy
npx wrangler pages deploy .svelte-kit/output/client --project-name=blueballs-2
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in Cloudflare Pages:

1. Go to your project in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Environment variables**
3. Add/verify these variables:

### Required Variables:

```
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://onigvijfusxtycronhhm.supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MID=your-mid-tier-price-id
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BIG=your-big-tier-price-id
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=blueballs
```

### Optional (for test mode):

```
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=your-test-secret-key
STRIPE_TEST_PRICE_ID_MID=your-test-mid-price
STRIPE_TEST_PRICE_ID_BIG=your-test-big-price
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, test these critical flows:

### 1. Authentication Flow
- âœ… Login with email/password
- âœ… Login with Google OAuth
- âœ… Login with Discord OAuth
- âœ… Logout (verify you're actually logged out)
- âœ… Try to login again after logout

### 2. Payment Flow
- âœ… Click "Upgrade to Mid" or "Upgrade to Big"
- âœ… Verify redirect to Stripe's hosted checkout page
- âœ… Press browser back button - should return to subscribe page safely
- âœ… Complete a test payment (if in test mode)
- âœ… Verify redirect back to success page
- âœ… Check that subscription is active in your account

### 3. Session Persistence
- âœ… Refresh the page while logged in
- âœ… Open in new tab - should still be logged in
- âœ… Close and reopen browser - should still be logged in
- âœ… Logout and verify session is cleared

## OAuth Configuration Updates

**IMPORTANT:** Update your OAuth provider settings:

### Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Make sure **Authorized redirect URIs** includes:
   - `https://onigvijfusxtycronhhm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - `https://your-cloudflare-pages-domain.pages.dev/auth/callback` (if needed)

### Discord Developer Portal
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Go to **OAuth2** section
4. Make sure **Redirects** includes:
   - `https://onigvijfusxtycronhhm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

See `OAUTH_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### If logout doesn't work:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try in incognito/private mode
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase URL is correct in environment variables

### If Stripe redirects fail:
1. Check Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Verify webhook endpoint is configured
3. Check success_url and cancel_url in Stripe checkout settings
4. Make sure environment variables are set correctly

### If OAuth fails:
1. Verify callback URLs in Google/Discord console
2. Check Supabase Auth settings in dashboard
3. Ensure Client ID and Secret are correct
4. Test in incognito mode to rule out cookie issues
